## **WiFiXpress: Tactical Wireless Automation**

Is automation automatic-utility built around the principle of **QaR** (*Quick and Respond*).<br> 
Why waste precious time typing out endless commands, juggling multiple terminals, or sweating over syntax errors, when WiFiXpress can handle the grunt work for you.

### With WiFiXpress, you can:
  -> **Run Hashcat Effortlessly**: Automate capturing and output preparation to send directly to your cracking tool of choice.  
  -> **Set Custom Capture Times**: Whether you're staying passive or diving in aggressively, the timer feature gives you precision control over your capture sessions.  
  -> **Active/Passive Modes**: Go loud or stay sneakybeaky~ â€”WiFiXpress responds to your operational needs.  
  -> **Save and Review History**: Every move you make is logged, so you can easily retrace your steps or refine your process.  
  -> **Generate Organized Outputs**: Never again sift through chaos; WiFiXpress provides clean and accessible data when you need it most.  

Let's not shit ourselves â€”whether you're an operator under pressure or just someone too lazy to type airmon-ng for the hundredth time,<br> **WiFiXpress** has your back.<br> Itâ€™s not just a tool 
-itâ€™s a way of life for those who value speed, automation, and the occasional touch of recklessness.

## *Installation*
**Tools you need:** ```aircrack-ng (airodump-ng, aireplay-ng)```, ```hashcat```, ```tcpdump```.<br>

**Just download WiFiXpress and:**<br>
set chmod permission to execute file: 
```
  chmod +x WifiXpress.sh
```
### Usage: 
```
  sudo ./WifiXpress.sh
```
### Enter parameters: 
```
  Enter network interface: <Your Network Interface>
  BSSID: <Router BSSID>
  Enter Channel: <channel>
  Set time to capturing (optional:120sec):
  Output: <name your output without *.txt*>
```

## Troubleshooting: 
### ðŸ”´**tools not found**: 
```tools not found, Install it before using script```
Fix: Install the necessary tools:
Ubuntu/Debian:
```
sudo apt install aircrack-ng
```
Arch:
```
sudo pacman -S aircrack-ng
```
Fedora:
```
sudo dnf install aircrack-ng
```
### ðŸ”´**Network Interface is not avaiable/error**:
```
  Error: The network interface <INTERFACE> does not exist!
```
Fix: Provide a **valid network interface** name.<br>
-> Still broken? Manually identify the interface name and comment out lines 55-65 in the script with:<br> ```:<< END <Code lines 55-65> END```:

### QaR Philosophy
*Quick and Response (QaR) â€“ Scripts and automation that make shit happen without the annoying manual grind. I build tools that take care of the boring stuff so you can stop wasting time and just get things done. No more babysitting your computer â€”just provide inputs and lets roll.*<br>
Daaamn son, you'll see what real automation is all about! (O^O)<br>
