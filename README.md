# **WiFiXpress: Tactical Wireless Automation**

### **WiFiXpress** is a streamlined, tactical-grade WiFi utility built around the principle of **QaR** (*Quick and Respond*). Why waste precious time typing out endless commands, juggling multiple terminals, or sweating over syntax errors when WiFiXpress can handle the grunt work for you?

### With WiFiXpress, you can:
  -> **Run Hashcat Effortlessly**: Automate capturing and output preparation to send directly to your cracking tool of choice.  
  -> **Set Custom Capture Times**: Whether you're staying passive or diving in aggressively, the timer feature gives you precision control over your capture sessions.  
  -> **Switch Between Active and Passive Modes**: Go loud or stay sneaky-beakyâ€”WiFiXpress responds to your operational needs.  
  -> **Save and Review History**: Every move you make is logged, so you can easily retrace your steps or refine your process.  
  -> **Generate Organized Outputs**: Never again sift through chaos; WiFiXpress provides clean and accessible data when you need it most.  

This tool isnâ€™t just a utility; itâ€™s your exit strategy when your time is important.**WiFiXpress** makes sure you can grab what you need and get out, fast and unnoticed.
And let's not shit ourselvesâ€”whether you're an operator under pressure or just someone too lazy to type airmon-ng for the hundredth time,<br> **WiFiXpress** has your back. Itâ€™s not just a tool 
-itâ€™s a way of life for those who value speed, automation, and the occasional touch of recklessness.

## *Installation*
**Tools you need:** ```aircrack-ng (airodump-ng, aireplay-ng)```, ```hashcat```, ```tcpdump```.
**Just download WiFiXpress and:**<br>
set chmod permission to execute file
```
  chmod +x WifiXpress.sh
```
## Usage: 
```
  sudo ./WifiXpress.sh
```
### Provide your parameters: 
```
  Enter network interface: <Your Network Interface>
  BSSID: <Router BSSID>
  Enter Channel: <channel>
  Set time to capturing (optional:120sec):
  Output: <name your output without *.txt*>
```

## Troubleshooting: 
### ðŸ”´**tools not found**: 
```tools not found, Install it before using script```
Fix: Install the necessary tools:
Ubuntu/Debian:
```
sudo apt install aircrack-ng
```
Arch:
```
sudo pacman -S aircrack-ng
```
Fedora:
```
sudo dnf install aircrack-ng
```
### ðŸ”´**Network Interface is not avaiable/error**:
```
  Error: The network interface <INTERFACE> does not exist!
  [The IF with Net.Inter. search]-> [if ! ip link show "$INTERFACE" &>/dev/null; then...]
```
Fix: Provide a **valid network interface** name.
-> Still broken? Manually identify the interface name and comment out lines 55-65 in the script.

### QaR Philosophy
*Quick and Response (QaR) â€“ Scripts and automation that make shit happen without the annoying manual grind. I build tools that take care of the boring stuff so you can stop wasting time and just get things done. No more babysitting your computer â€”just provide inputs and lets roll.*
Daaamn son, you'll see what real automation is all about! (O^O)
**"Quick hands save lives!"**
